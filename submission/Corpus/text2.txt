Another point to consider is whether Article 12(6) can be applied. It states that the controller has the right to request further information from the data subject if it has reasonable doubts about the identity of the natural person making the request. The additional information should be necessary to confirm the identity of the applicant and is without prejudice to Article 11. In this case, Article 12(6) does not apply to Grindr, as Grindr already has all relevant information to identify the complainant at the time of the request. In order to submit a request via the online form, the email address associated with the Grindr account must be provided. In addition, this address must be confirmed by ticking a box under the email address. It is also not possible to submit a request without providing the email address associated with the account.

When looking further into Grindr's compliance with Article 12(3), it became clear that Grindr was taking too long to process the request. In examining Grindr's compliance with Article 12(2) and its obligation to communicate clearly and transparently, it is also clear that Grindr's demanding process for identifying the requester does not match the simplicity and clarity required by the GDPR. As discussed above, this adds complexity and limits the user's understanding and access to their rights. Grindr's complex verification process not only impacts users, but also raises critical data minimization concerns. Grindr requires extensive information to fulfill the request, which leads to the question whether this is still compatible with the principle of data minimization in Article 5(1)(c). This principle states that only a necessary amount of data should be collected that is related to the purposes for which it is processed. (European Union, 2023)
