In addition, it can be said that Grindr has already provided a tool in its application that represents a less data-driven approach to authenticating users. In order to download the data, Grindr confirms the information that users have entered during the registration process. This includes email address, date of birth and a password. If any user can obtain a copy of their data by downloading it within their application, there would be no reason to request extensive information about users attempting to exercise their rights via an online form. It can also be pointed out that the information required to create an account on Grindr cannot be linked to the civilian identity of users. The requirement for an official ID and a photo of the person is not suitable for confirming the "Grindr identity" with the details of the civilian identity. Particularly on dating platforms such as Grindr, the use of the platform should be possible in an anonymous way. (noyb, 2021a)
In summary, Grindr's approach to identifying and authenticating users raises significant concerns with regard to the principle of data minimization. The requirement for government-issued IDs and personal photos for identity verification goes beyond what is necessary to confirm a user's "Grindr identity" and violates the principle of data minimization. The availability of a less data-intensive method within the Grindr app emphasizes the disproportionality of its approach and indicates a misalignment with the GDPR, which aims to capture only what is essential and respect users' privacy in the digital space.
