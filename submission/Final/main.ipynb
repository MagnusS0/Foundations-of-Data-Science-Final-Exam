    "# Introduction to the StringSimilarity Class\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StringSimilarity` class is a powerful tool designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, particularly focusing on computing the similarity between different text documents. Its primary function revolves around processing text, evaluating similarity scores, and managing a collection of text documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Structure and Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Folder Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StringSimilarity` class is part of a broader project structure, designed to streamline file management and ease of use. All essential files and folders are neatly organized within a main directory named \"final\". This structured approach ensures efficient access and processing of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Directory: \"final\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which houses the `StringSimilarity` class, is located at the root of this main directory. This notebook serves as the central script for executing the class's functionality.\n",
    "- An example text file is also placed in the \"final\" directory. This file can be used for initial testing and demonstration purposes, providing a practical example of how the class processes and compares text.\n",
    "- The `Corpus` folder, a critical component of the project, is situated within the \"final\" directory. It contains a selection of text files, labeled `text1.txt`, `text2.txt`, and `text3.txt`. These files constitute the text corpus against which new documents are compared for similarity.\n",
    "- This consolidated folder structure not only ensures a tidy and logical organization of files but also simplifies the class's operation. Users can effortlessly navigate through the project, add new documents, and perform similarity analysis without the hassle of complex file management.\n",
    "\n",
    "By maintaining this clear and concise folder structure, the `StringSimilarity` class within the \"final\" directory stands as a user-friendly and efficient solution for text similarity assessment, enhancing the overall experience of users engaging with this NLP tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__init__` method serves as the class constructor, setting up essential structures for document storage and processing. \n",
    "- Key structures initialized include:\n",
    "  - `document_pool`: A dictionary to hold processed documents.\n",
    "  - `vector_pool`: A repository for the vector representations of these documents.\n",
    "  - `dictionary`: A set to store unique words across all documents, crucial for vectorization and textual analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Cleaning and Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stopwords, common words with limited informational value, are listed for exclusion during text processing. \n",
    "- The class employs methods like `cleaning_text`, `string_to_list`, and `main_cleaning` for preparing text data. These methods collectively facilitate the removal of non-words, normalization of text, and exclusion of stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Management and Corpus Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods such as `add_documents`, `load_text`, and `create_corpus` enable efficient document management.\n",
    "- These functions allow adding individual texts or batches of texts, processing them, and updating the document pool and dictionary accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Representation and Similarity Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `create_vector` method translates documents into binary vectors based on the class's dictionary, capturing the presence or absence of words.\n",
    "- The class offers various similarity computation methods (`dot_product_normal`, `cosine_Similarity`, `Euclidean_distance`, `Jaccard_similarity`) to cater to different analytical needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `user_interaction` method allows for versatile user engagement, enabling users to input a text string or specify a file for comparison.\n",
    "- Users can choose the similarity metric to apply, and the function returns a DataFrame showing the calculated similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StringSimilarity` class is an embodiment of versatility and efficiency in text similarity analysis. Whether it's for academic research, content recommendation systems, or other NLP applications, this class provides a robust foundation for comparing text documents, making it a valuable asset in the field of computational linguistics and data analysis.\n"

      "was not greatly loved by its rivals. An element which appealed\n",

      "which could hardly have been heartier had the applauders known how\n",
      "true a type that act supplied of Her Majesty's future conduct. She\n",

      "movement and its rapid spread formed a significant reply to the\n",
      "insensate calls for vengeance on England which had risen from the\n",
      "French army, and which seemed worthy of attention in view of the vast\n",
      "increase now made in the naval strength of France, and of other\n",
      "preparations indicating that the Emperor meditated a great military\n",
      "enterprise. That enterprise proved to be the war with Austria which\n",
      "did so much for Italy, and which some observers were disposed to\n",
      "connect with the plot of Orsini--a rough reminder to the Emperor,\n",
      "they said, that he was trifling with the cause of Italian unity, to\n",
      "which he was secretly pledged. But Englishmen were slow to believe in\n",
      "such designs on the part of the French ruler. \"How should a despot\n",

      "enough by an anonymous poet of the day; and they enrolled themselves\n",
      "in great numbers for national defence. With this movement there might\n",

      "manufacturing districts, directly caused up the action of the\n",
      "Northern States in blockading the Southern ports, and thus cutting\n",
      "off our supply of raw  material in the shape of cotton. On its side\n",
      "the North, which had calculated securely on English sympathy and\n",
      "respect, and was profoundly irritated by the many displays of a\n",
      "contrary feeling; and the exasperation on both sides more than once\n",
      "reached a point which made war appear almost inevitable--a war above\n",
      "all others to be deprecated. First came the affair of the\n",
      "_Trent_--the English mail-steamer from  which two  Southern envoys\n",
      "were carried off by an American naval commander, in contempt of the\n",
      "protection of the British flag. The action was technically illegal,\n",
      "and on the demand of the English Government its illegality was\n",
      "acknowledged, and the captives were restored; but the warlike and\n",
      "threatening tone of England on this occasion was bitterly resented at\n",
      "the North, and this resentment was greatly increased when it became\n",
      "known that various armed cruisers, in particular the notorious\n",
      "_Alabama_, designed to prey on the Northern commerce, were being\n",
      "built and fitted  by English  shipbuilders in English dockyards under\n",
      "the direction of the Southern foe, while the English Government could\n",
      "not decide if it were legally competent for Her Majesty's Ministers\n",
      "to interfere and detain such vessels. The tardy action at last taken\n",
      "just prevented the breaking out of hostilities. Out of these\n",
      "unfortunate transactions a certain good was to ensue at a date not\n",
      "far distant, when, after the restoration of peace, America and\n",
      "England, disputing as to the compensation due from one to the other\n",
      "for injuries sustained in this matter, gave to the world the great\n",
      "example of two nations submitting a point so grave to peaceful\n",
      "arbitration, instead of calling in the sword to make an end of it--an\n",
      "example more nearly pointing to the possible extinction of war than\n",
      "any other event of the world's history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet another hopeful feature may be noted in connection with this time\n",
      "of trouble. While the Secession war lasted, \"the cotton famine\" had\n",
      "full sway in Lancashire; unwonted and unwelcome light and stillness\n",
      "replaced the dun clouds of smoke and the busy hum that used to tell\n",
      "of fruitful, well-paid industry; and the patient people, haggard and\n",
      "pale but sadly submissive, were kept, and just kept, from starving by\n",
      "the incessant charitable effort of their countrymen. Never had the\n",
      "attitude of the suffering working classes shown such genuine\n",
      "nobility; they understood that the calamity which lay heavy on them\n",
      "was not brought about by the careless and selfish tyranny of their\n",
      "worldly superiors, but came in the order of God's providence; and\n",
      "their conduct at this crisis proved that an immense advance had been\n",
      "made in kindliness between class and class, and in true intelligence\n",
      "and appreciation of the difficulties proper to each. It was\n",
      "significant of this new temper that when at last peace returned,\n",
      "bringing some gleam of returning prosperity, the workers, who greeted\n",
      "with joyful tears the first bales of cotton that arrived, fell on\n",

      "even at the moment, by the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The year 1861 had already been darkened for Her Majesty by the death\n",
      "in the month of March, of her mother, the Duchess of Kent, to whose\n",
      "wise guardianship of the Queen's youth the nation owed so much, and\n",
      "who had ever commanded the faithful affection of this her youngest\n",
      "but greatest child, and of all her descendants. This death was the\n",
      "first stroke of real personal calamity to the Queen; it was destined\n",
      "to be followed by another bereavement, even severer in its nature,\n",
      "before the year had closed. The Prince Consort's health, though\n",
      "generally good, was not robust, and signs had not been wanting that\n",
      "his incessant toils were beginning to tell upon him. There had been\n",
      "illnesses, transitory indeed, but too significant of \"overwork of\n",
      "brain and body.\" In addition to personal griefs, such as the death of\n",
      "the Duchess of Kent and of a beloved young Coburg prince and kinsman,\n",
      "the King of Portugal, which had been severely felt, there were the\n",
      "unhappy complications arising out of \"the affair of the _Trent_,\"\n",
      "which the Prince's statesmanlike wisdom had helped to bring to a\n",
      "peaceful and honourable conclusion. That wisdom, unhappily, was no\n",
      "longer at the service of England when a series of negligences and\n",
      "ignorances on the part of England's statesmen had landed us in the\n",
      "_Alabama_ difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these agitations had told upon a frame which was rather\n",

      "illness came against which he was not able to struggle, but which\n",
      "took all the country by surprise when, on December 14th, it\n",
      "terminated in death. Very many had hardly been aware that there was\n",
      "danger until the midnight tolling of the great bell of St. Paul's\n",

      "it was that was thus knelled forth they knew not, and could hardly\n",
      "believe the tidings when given in articulate words.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first it had been said, the Prince had a feverish cold; presently\n",

      "given, a burden of woe almost unspeakable, and for which the heart of\n",
      "the nation throbbed with well-nigh unbearable sympathy. Seldom has\n",

      "That supremacy had been imperilled for a moment when the Government\n",

      "Gladstone--whose \"long Parliamentary duel\" had begun early in the\n",
      "fifties of this century--outbidding each other by turns for the\n",
      "public favour, and each in his different way ministering to the\n",
      "popular craving for reform. With Mr. Disraeli's first appearance as\n",
      "leader of the house of Commons, this rivalry entered on its most\n",

      "brilliant, versatile, and daring _litterateur_ and statesman who died\n",

      "year following similar measures with regard to Ireland and Scotland.\n",
      "In 1869 it was Mr. Gladstone's turn, and he introduced and carried\n",
      "two remarkable Bills--one for the disestablishment of the Irish\n",
      "Church, and one for the amendment of land tenure in Ireland, the\n",
      "latter passing into law in August, 1870. It had long been felt as a\n",
      "bitter grievance by the mass of Irishmen that the Church established\n",
      "in their country should be one which did not command the allegiance\n",
      "of one-sixth of its people and though opinion in England was sharply\n",
      "divided as to the question of Irish disestablishment, the majority of\n",
      "Englishmen undoubtedly considered the grievance to be something more\n",
      "than a sentimental one, and deserving of removal. Another startling\n",
      "measure of reform was the abolition of purchase in the army, carried\n",
      "in the face of a reluctant House of Lords by means of a sudden\n",
      "exercise of royal prerogative under advice of the Government; the\n",
      "Premier announcing \"that as the system of purchase was the creation\n",
      "of royal regulation, he had advised the Queen to take the decisive\n",

      "A measure which may not improbably prove to have affected the\n",
      "fortunes of this country more extensively than any of those already\n",
      "enumerated was the Education Bill introduced by Mr. Forster in 1870,\n",
      "and designed to secure public elementary education for even the\n",
      "humblest classes throughout England and Wales. Hitherto the teaching\n",
      "of the destitute poor had been largely left to private charity or\n",
      "piety, and in the crowded towns it had been much neglected, with the\n",
      "great exception of the work done in Ragged Schools--those gallant\n",
      "efforts made by unpaid Christian zeal to cope with the multitudinous\n",
      "ignorance and misery of our overgrown cities. It was very slowly that\n",
      "the national conscience was aroused to the peril and sin of allowing\n",
      "the masses to grow up in heathen ignorance; but at last the English\n",
      "State shook off its sluggish indifference to the instruction of its\n",
      "poor, and became as active as it had been supine. Mr. Forster's Bill\n",
      "is the measure which indicates this turning of the tide. We do not\n",
      "propose now to discuss the provisions of this Act, which were sharply\n",
      "canvassed at the time, and which certainly have not worked without\n",
      "friction; but we may say that the stimulus then given to educational\n",
      "activity, if judged by subsequent results, must be acknowledged to\n",
      "have been advantageous. The system of schools under the charge of\n",
      "various religious bodies, which existed before the Education Act, has\n",
      "not been superseded; that indeed would have been a deep misfortune,\n",
      "for it is more needed than ever; the masses of the population have\n",
      "been, to an appreciable extent, reached and instructed; and we shall\n",
      "not much err in connecting as cause and effect the wider instruction\n",

      "The same member who honoured himself and benefited his country by\n",
      "this great effort to promote the advance of the \"angel Knowledge\"\n",
      "also introduced, in 1871, the Ballot Bill, designed to do away with\n",
      "all the violence and corruption that had long disgraced Parliamentary\n",
      "elections in this free land, and that showed no symptom of a tendency\n",
      "to reform themselves. The new system of secret voting which was now\n",
      "adopted has required, it is true, to be further purified by the\n",
      "recent Corrupt Practices Bill and its stringent provisions; but no\n",
      "one, whose memory is long enough to recall the tumultuous and\n",
      "discreditable scenes attendant on elections under the old system,\n",
      "will be inclined to deny that much that was flagrantly disgraceful as\n",
      "well as dishonest has been swept away by the reforming energy of our\n",
      "own day.\n",

      "It is to the same period, made memorable by these internal reforms,\n",
      "that we have to refer the final settlement of the long-standing\n",
      "controversy between Great Britain and the United States as to the\n",
      "_Alabama_ claims. We have already referred to these claims and the\n",
      "peaceful though very costly manner of their adjustment. That the\n",
      "award on the whole should go against us was not very grateful to the\n",
      "English people; but when the natural irritation of the hour had time\n",
      "to subside, the substantial justice of the decision was little\n",
      "disputed. While England was thus busied in strengthening her walls\n",
      "and making straight her ways, her great neighbour and rival was\n",
      "passing through a very furnace of misery. The colossal-seeming\n",
      "Empire, whose head was rather of strangely mingled Corinthian metal\n",
      "than of fine gold, and whose iron feet were mixed with miry clay, was\n",
      "tottering to its overthrow, and fell in the wild days of 1870 with a\n",
      "world-awakening crash. Again it was a dispute concerning the throne\n",
      "of Spain which precipitated the fall of a French sovereign. It would\n",
      "seem as if interference with the affairs of its Southern neighbour\n",
      "was ever to be ominous of evil to France. The first great Napoleon\n",
      "had had to rue such interference; it had been disastrous to Louis\n",
      "Philippe; now Louis Napoleon, making the candidature of Leopold of\n",
      "Hohenzollern for the Spanish crown a pretext for war with Prussia,\n",
      "forced on the strife which was to dethrone himself, to cast down his\n",
      "dynasty, and to despoil France of two fair provinces, Alsace and\n",
      "Lorraine, once taken from Germany, now reconquered for United\n",
      "Germany. With that strife, which resulted in the exaltation of the\n",
      "Prussian King, our Princess Royal's father-in-law, as German Emperor,\n",
      "England had absolutely nothing to do, except to pity the fallen and\n",

      "success than for his bad government--escaped to the safety of this\n",

      "practical Britain prefers a system, however illogical, that actually\n",

      "here that was wrought in the last century by the French Reign of\n",
      "Terror, and English republicanism relapsed into the dormant state\n",
      "from which it had only just awakened. The dangerous illness that\n",

      "sent out in 1838 to deal with the rebellion in Lower Canada, we owe\n",
      "the inauguration of a totally new scheme of colonial policy, which\n",
      "has been crowned with success wherever it has been introduced. It has\n",
      "succeeded in the vast Canadian Dominion, now stretching from ocean to\n",
      "ocean, and embracing all British North America, with the single\n",
      "exception of the Isle of Newfoundland. In 1867 this Federation was\n",
      "first formed, uniting then only the two Canadas with New Brunswick\n",
      "and Nova Scotia, under a constitution framed on Lord Durham's plan,\n",
      "and providing for the management of common affairs by a central\n",
      "Parliament, while each province should have its own local\n",
      "legislature, and the executive be vested in the Crown, ruling through\n",
      "its Governor General. It had been made competent for the other\n",
      "provinces of British North America to join this Federation, if they\n",
      "should so will; and one after another has joined it, with the one\n",
      "exception mentioned above, which may or may not be permanent. The\n",
      "population of the Dominion has trebled, and its revenues have\n",
      "increased twenty-fold, since its constitution was thus settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same system, it may be hoped, will equally succeed in that\n",
      "wonderful Australasia where our colonists now have the shaping of\n",
      "their destinies in their own hands, amid the yet unexplored amplitude\n",
      "of a land where \"in the softest and sweetest air, and in an\n",
      "unexhausted soil, the fable of Midas is reversed; food does not turn\n",
      "to gold, but the gold with which the land is teeming converts itself\n",

      "with the wild gold-fever and the wreck and ruin which that fever too\n",

      "concerned, came virtually to an end with the discovery of gold in the\n",
      "region to which we had been shipping off our criminals. The colonists\n",
      "had long been complaining of this system, which at first sight had\n",
      "much to recommend it, as offering a fair chance of reformation to the\n",

      "But it was found, as a high official said, that convict labour was\n",
      "far less valuable than the uncompelled work of honest freemen; and\n",

      "made them little welcome. When to these drawbacks were added the\n",
      "difficulties and dangers with which the presence of the convict\n",
      "element in the population encumbered the new gold-mining industry,\n",
      "the question reached the burning stage. The system was modified in\n",
      "1853, and totally abolished in 1857. Transports whose sentence were\n",
      "unexpired lingered out their time in Tasmania, whence the aborigines\n",

      "The bitter experiences through which the Church passed called\n",

      "ministers to consider the question; 745 laymen were invited to join\n",
      "them. Their recommendations led Conference to adopt resolutions\n",

      "Conference. Provision was made for the trial of trustees, so that\n",
      "every justice should be done them. Local Church meetings were\n",
      "guaranteed the right of appeal to Conference, and circuits were\n",

      "amply suffice us to remark that Wesleyan Methodism, thanks to the\n",
      "modifications of its constitution which we have briefly touched upon,\n",
      "is one of the most truly popular Church systems ever devised. For, as\n",
      "the Pastoral Address of 1896 puts it, \"Methodism gives every class,\n",

      "The great change just described, being the work of the ministers\n",
      "themselves, and accomplished by them before there was any loud demand\n",
      "for it, was effected with such moderation and discretion as not to\n",
      "entail the loss of a single member or minister. This was justly held\n",
      "a cause for great thankfulness; and it was determined to raise a\n",
      "thanksgiving fund for the relief of the various departments.\n",

      "Great central meetings, extending over two years (1878--1880), were\n",
      "held throughout the country, and were characterised by enthusiasm and\n",
      "wonderful generosity. At a time when the country was suffering almost\n",
      "unheard of commercial depression, the sum of L297,500 was raised, to\n",
      "be apportioned between Foreign Missions, the Extension of Methodism\n",

      "the relief of necessitous local preachers, and the promotion of\n",

      "\n",
      "Such work could not be done if the circuits acted independently; but\n",
      "united as they are, and forming one vast connexion, much which would\n",
      "otherwise be impossible can be achieved by means of the great\n",
      "Connexional funds. Of these funds not a few have been established\n",
      "since 1837; but the most important among them, the Foreign Mission\n",
      "fund, can boast an earlier origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wesleyanism, indeed, is essentially missionary in spirit, her\n",
      "original aim being to spread scriptural holiness throughout the\n",
      "world. \"The world is my parish,\" said Wesley though he himself could\n",
      "never visit the whole of that parish, his followers have at least\n",
      "explored the greater part of it, causing the darkness to flee before\n",
      "the radiance of the lamp of truth.\n",

      "British Methodism has now missions in almost every quarter of the\n",
      "globe--in Asia, in Africa, on the Continent of Europe, in the Western\n",
      "Hemisphere. Her mission agencies include medical missions, hospitals,\n",
      "schools for the blind, homes for lepers, orphanages, training and\n",
      "industrial schools, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Europe we have set on foot missions in countries that are\n",
      "nominally Christian, where the people are too often the victims of\n",
      "ignorance, wickedness, vice, scepticism, and superstition; France,\n",
      "Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, and Portugal have all been objects of\n",
      "our missionary enterprise during the present reign, and in some\n",
      "instances conspicuous success has been attained. Witness the good\n",

      "by the _Conference, Methodiste de France_.\n",

      "In India, Ceylon, China, and Burma, our agents are working amongst\n",
      "races in which they have to combat heathenism strong in its\n",
      "antiquity. The progress is necessarily slow, but a point has been\n",
      "reached where great success may be prophesied, as the result largely\n",
      "of the work of the pioneers. The schools are turning out many who, if\n",
      "they do not all become decided Christians, are intellectually\n",
      "convinced that Christianity is right, and will put fewer difficulties\n",
      "in the way of their children than they themselves had to contend\n",
      "with. This educational work prepares the way for the gospel;\n",
      "observers declare that nearly all converts in Ceylon have been\n",
      "trained in our schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important missions in Southern and Western Africa must not be\n",
      "forgotten, nor those in Honduras and the Bahamas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The present policy throughout our actual mission-field is as far as\n",
      "possible to raise up native agents. Probably the heathen lands will\n",
      "be won for the great Captain of salvation by native soldiers; but for\n",
      "a long time they will need officers trained in countries familiar for\n",
      "generations with the blessings of the gospel. The number of our\n",
      "missionaries may be stated at 400, more than half being native\n",
      "agents; there are 2,680 other mission workers, 52,058 Church members;\n",
      "84,113 children and young people having instruction in the schools.\n",
      "But these figures would give a false idea of the progress of the work\n",
      "if compared with the statistics of 1837; for _then_ our missions\n",
      "included vast regions that have now their own Conferences. When the\n",
      "Queen ascended the throne Fiji was a nation of cannibals. Two years\n",
      "before her accession our Missionary Society commenced operations in\n",
      "those islands. John Hunt laboured with apostolic zeal, and died\n",
      "breathing the prayer, \"God, for Christ's sake, bless Fiji, save\n",
      "Fiji.\" The prayer is already answered. All these islands have been\n",
      "won for Christ, and are trophies of Wesleyan missionary toil. There\n",
      "are 3,100 native preachers under the care of nine white missionaries;\n",
      "1,322 chapels, 43,339 members and catechumens, and more than 42,000\n",
      "scholars. Fiji has become almost a nation of Methodists. But it were\n",
      "vain to look for traces of this vast achievement in the \"Minutes of\n",
      "Conference\" of 1896; for a special feature of our missionary policy\n",
      "is the establishment of affiliated Conferences, which in course of\n",
      "time become self-supporting. In 1883 all the branches of the Canadian\n",
      "Methodists united to form one Canadian Conference. The first French\n",
      "Conference met in 1852. In 1855 the Conference of Eastern British\n",
      "America was formed. The same year the first Australian Conference\n",
      "met, and took charge of the Missions in Fiji, the Friendly Isles, and\n",
      "New Zealand. The first South African Conference met in 1882, and the\n",
      "two West Indian Conferences in 1884. Although more or less\n",
      "independent of the mother Conference, they still retain the\n",
      "characteristics of Methodism. A distinct branch of Mission work,\n",
      "known as the Women's Auxiliary, has been established, and sends forth\n",
      "ladies to engage in educational, zenana, and medical work. They are\n",
      "doing good service in India, China, and other parts of the world. In\n",
      "1896 they expended more than L10,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total expenditure last year (1896) was L124,700, incurred by our\n",
      "own Mission work and by grants to the affiliated Conferences. It is\n",
      "satisfactory to note that in the districts helped, including those\n",
      "covered by these Conferences, an additional L185,000 was raised. We\n",
      "have magnificent opportunities; and with full consecration of our\n",
      "people's wealth there would be glorious successes in the future.\n",
      "Foreign Missions have been the chief honour of Methodism, and it is\n",
      "to be hoped the same affection for them will be maintained; for\n",
      "wherever Methodism is found throughout the world, it is the result of\n",
      "mission work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile there has been no sacrificing of home interests. Never were\n",
      "greater efforts made by Methodism for the evangelisation of the\n",
      "masses in Great Britain. The Home Mission Fund, first instituted in\n",
      "1756, was remodelled in 1856. Its business is to assist the dependent\n",
      "circuits in maintaining the administration of the gospel, to provide\n",
      "means for employing additional ministers, and to meet various\n",
      "contingencies with which the circuits could not cope unassisted. Our\n",
      "needs as a Connexion demand such a Contingent Fund. One-third of the\n",
      "amount raised by the Juvenile Home and Foreign Missionary Association\n",
      "is devoted to Home Missions. The income, which in 1837 was less than\n",
      "L10.000, is now more than L36,000; an increase witnessing to a spirit\n",
      "of aggression and enterprise in modern Methodism. This fund provides\n",
      "for the support of the Connexional evangelists and district\n",
      "missionaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 1882, under the head \"Home Missions,\" there was a new and\n",
      "important departure, by the appointment of the first \"Connexional\n",
      "evangelists,\" of whom there are now four; they have already been the\n",
      "means of great blessing throughout the country, showing that the old\n",
      "gospel, preached as in the old days, is still mighty to awaken and\n",
      "convert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the direction of the Home Mission Committee, commissioners\n",
      "visit certain districts, to give advice and discover the best methods\n",
      "for improving the condition of Methodism where it appears to be low.\n",
      "\n",
      "Special attention is given to the villages. The \"Out-and-Out Band\"\n",
      "subscribed for four Gospel Mission vans, each carrying two\n",
      "evangelists, and a large quantity of literature, to the villages; the\n",
      "evangelists in charge conducting services in the village chapels and\n",
      "in the open air. The sale of books and the voluntary contributions of\n",
      "the people help to defray the expenses. This agency is now under the\n",
      "direction of the Home Mission committee, and the gospel cars will be\n",
      "known as \"Wesleyan Home Mission Cars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another new movement, helpful to village Methodism, is the \"Joyful\n",
      "News\" mission, originating with the Rev. Thomas Champness, who has\n",
      "been set free from ordinary circuit work to manage it. He trains lay\n",
      "agents, for whose services there is a great demand in villages where\n",
      "the people are too poor to maintain additional ministers, and where\n",
      "the supply of local preachers is deficient. Some of these agents are\n",
      "at work abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The energetic Home Mission Committee has also set on foot missions\n",
      "where Methodism was feeble. Nor are those forgotten who \"go down to\n",
      "the sea in ships, and do business in great waters.\" As far as means\n",
      "permit, efforts are made for the spiritual benefit of our sailors in\n",
      "all the great ports of the world; our soldiers, too, are equally\n",
      "cared for. Methodism has always been interested in the army, in which\n",
      "some of Wesley's best converts were found; yet there was no\n",
      "systematic work in it before 1839, when an order by the\n",
      "commander-in-chief permitted every soldier to attend the church of\n",
      "his choice. Some years afterwards, the Rev. Dr. Rule strove hard to\n",
      "secure the recognition of the rights of Wesleyans, and after much\n",
      "struggle the War Office recognised Wesleyan chaplains. The work and\n",
      "position of Wesleyan Methodism are now thoroughly organised\n",
      "throughout the world. The government allows a capitation grant for\n",
      "all declared Wesleyans, and it amounts to a large sum of money every\n",
      "year. In 1896 there were, including the Militia, 22,663 declared\n",
      "Wesleyans in the army and 1,485 Church members. There are 28 Sailors'\n",
      "and Soldiers' Homes, providing 432 beds, and these Homes have been\n",
      "established at a cost of L35,000. In them are coffee bars, libraries,\n",
      "lecture halls, and, what is most appreciated by Christian soldiers,\n",
      "rooms for private prayer. The officiating ministers, who give the\n",
      "whole or part of their time to the soldiers and their families,\n",
      "number 195.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many local preachers among the soldiers, and at least two\n",
      "have left the ranks to become ministers.\n",

      "On the Mission field, soldiers render valuable aid to the missionary\n",
      "in building chapels, distributing tracts, and often teaching and\n",
      "preaching to the natives and others. Thus, whilst helping to hold the\n",
      "empire for their Queen, they are hastening on the day when all the\n",

      "One great event in Methodist history since 1837 now calls for\n",
      "notice--the assembling of the first Oecumenical Conference in\n",
      "Wesley's Chapel, City Road, London, in 1861. This idea was in strict\n",
      "keeping with the spirit Wesley discovered when, five weeks before his\n",
      "death, he wrote to his children in America: \"See that you never give\n",
      "place to one thought of separating from your brethren in Europe. Lose\n",
      "no opportunity of declaring to all men that the Methodists are one\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Sir Francis Lycett.]\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggestion took form at the Joint Conference of the Methodist\n",
      "Episcopal Church of America in 1876. The American Methodists sent a\n",
      "delegate to the British Conference, proposing a United Conference\n",
      "which should demonstrate to the world the essential oneness in\n",
      "doctrine, spirit, and principle of all the Churches which\n",
      "historically trace their origin to John Wesley; such a manifestation,\n",
      "it was hoped, would strengthen and perpetuate that unity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the Conference was to discover how to adjust our mission\n",
      "work so as to prevent waste and friction; suggesting also modes and\n",
      "agencies for the most successful work of evangelisation. Nor was this\n",
      "all; its promoters trusted to gain light on the relation of universal\n",
      "Methodism to education, civil government, other Christian bodies, and\n",
      "missionary enterprise at large, and looked for a vast increase in\n",
      "spiritual power and intelligent, enthusiastic activity among the\n",
      "various branches of Methodism, whose gathering together might well\n",
      "draw \"the attention of scholars and reformers and thinkers to the\n",
      "whole Methodist history, work, and mission,\" while a new impulse\n",
      "should be given to every good work, and a more daring purpose of\n",
      "evangelisation kindled. The British Conference pointed out the need\n",
      "of frankly recognising the not unimportant differences amongst the\n",
      "various Methodist bodies, so as to rule out of discussion any points\n",
      "which had a suggestion of past controversies. The American Conference\n",

      "Binney said that \"the direct instrumentality in his conversion was\n",

    "### Step 4: Creating and Managing Corpus\n",
    "This step showcases the `StringSimilarity` class's ability to automate the creation and management of a text corpus. This is a vital feature for handling multiple documents simultaneously and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `create_corpus` method is called to process and add all documents located within the 'Corpus' folder. This folder contains various text files that make up our text corpus.\n",
    "- This method reads each file in the 'Corpus' folder, cleans and processes the text using the class's internal methods, and then adds the resulting data to the class's internal structures for document management.\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this method, we print the current state of the class to confirm that the corpus has been successfully created and the internal structures (`document_pool`, `vector_pool`, `dictionary`, and `stopwords`) have been updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We also display the message returned by `create_corpus`, which indicates the outcome of the corpus creation process, such as the number of new documents added.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality exemplifies the class's robustness in handling multiple text files, automating the tedious process of manually adding each document. It's a demonstration of how the `StringSimilarity` class simplifies the management of a text corpus, making it a useful tool for large-scale text analysis.\n"

    "### Step 5: Text Preprocessing and Cleaning\n",
    "In this step, we demonstrate the crucial process of text preprocessing and cleaning, an essential part of any text analysis task. The `StringSimilarity` class provides a method `main_cleaning` that efficiently handles this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We start with a raw text string: `\"THIS is @n example string!!!stop-words, et 1, , 4 ,5 will be filtert__ out\"`. This string intentionally includes various elements like uppercase letters, special characters, numbers, and potential stop-words to illustrate the effectiveness of the cleaning process.\n",
    "- The `main_cleaning` method is applied to this raw text, which internally utilizes other class methods like `cleaning_text`, `string_to_list`, and `removing_stopwords`. These methods collectively perform various cleaning actions such as:\n",
    "    - Converting text to lowercase.\n",
    "    - Removing special characters and numbers.\n",
    "    - Stripping unnecessary whitespace.\n",
    "    - Filtering out stopwords.\n",
    "    - Excluding short words (less than 3 characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "- After cleaning, we display both the original and the cleaned text. The cleaned text should reflect the removal of unwanted elements and the standardization of the text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is a vital demonstration of the `StringSimilarity` class's ability to preprocess text, which is a foundational step in preparing text data for further similarity analysis. It shows how the class streamlines the transformation of raw, unstructured text into a cleaner, more analyzable format.\n"

    "### Step 6: Vector Representation\n",
    "In this part of our demonstration, we focus on converting cleaned text into a binary vector using the `StringSimilarity` class. The vector representation is a pivotal aspect of text similarity analysis as it quantifies the text in a format that can be easily compared using various similarity metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the `create_vector` method of the `StringSimilarity` class, we convert the previously cleaned text into a binary vector. This method works by mapping each word in the cleaned text against the class's word dictionary. \n",
    "- Each element of the vector corresponds to a unique word in the class’s dictionary. The binary value (0 or 1) for each element indicates the absence or presence of the corresponding word in the cleaned text.\n",
    "- The output is a binary vector, where '1' signifies the presence of a word from the cleaned text in the dictionary, and '0' indicates its absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is essential in transforming textual data into a numerical format, a prerequisite for employing mathematical techniques for similarity calculation. By showcasing the `create_vector` function, we highlight how the `StringSimilarity` class facilitates the transition from textual to numerical analysis, setting the stage for the next steps in text similarity computation.\n"

    "This step is the culmination of our journey through the `StringSimilarity` class, where we finally calculate similarity scores using various methods. The purpose here is to demonstrate how the class can be utilized to analyze the similarity of a new text document with the existing corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we load an external text file named \"example.txt\" using the `load_text` method. This showcases the class's ability to process and prepare external documents for analysis.\n",
    "- We then clean this loaded text using the `main_cleaning` method to ensure it's in the right format for similarity analysis. This step is vital as it ensures consistency in data preparation.\n",
    "- Next, we convert the cleaned text into a binary vector using the `create_vector` method, which is essential for numerical comparison.\n",
    "- Now, we calculate similarity scores using four different methods: `dot_product_normal`, `cosine_Similarity`, `Euclidean_distance`, and `Jaccard_similarity`. Each of these methods provides a unique approach to assessing text similarity, highlighting the versatility of the `StringSimilarity` class.\n",
    "  - The Dot Product method emphasizes direct overlap in words.\n",
    "  - Cosine Similarity focuses on the orientation of the text in the vector space, making it suitable for texts of varying lengths.\n",
    "  - Euclidean Distance provides a 'straight-line' measure of similarity, intuitive in its approach.\n",
    "  - Jaccard Similarity uses the ratio of common words to total words, effective for binary comparisons.\n",
    "- Finally, we display the results for each similarity score, providing a comprehensive view of how the new document compares to the existing corpus across multiple dimensions of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step not only illustrates the practical application of the `StringSimilarity` class but also provides insights into how different similarity metrics can be used in real-world scenarios, such as text comparison, recommendation systems, and more.\n"

    "In this final step, we demonstrate the user interaction capabilities of the `StringSimilarity` class. This step is crucial for showcasing how end users can easily utilize the class to analyze text similarity in practical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before we begin, we clean up our document pool by deleting \"Doc1,\" which was added in Step 2. This is done to maintain the purity of our corpus and ensure that our results are based on the original, unaltered corpus.\n",
    "- We then print the keys of the `document_pool` to confirm that \"Doc1\" has been successfully removed, ensuring our corpus is in its intended state.\n",
    "- Next, we simulate a user interaction scenario where a user inputs a string directly. We demonstrate this by using the `user_interaction` method with the \"string\" argument.\n",
    "- The `user_interaction` method is designed to be versatile, allowing users to either input a string directly or specify a file for text comparison. This flexibility makes the class highly accessible and user-friendly.\n",
    "- In this demonstration, we prompt the user to enter a string (in this case, \"Example user input text\"). The class then processes this input, calculates similarity scores using the different methods, and outputs the results.\n",
    "- This step exemplifies how the `StringSimilarity` class can be interactively used in real-world applications, such as content analysis, document retrieval, and text-based recommendation systems, where end-user interaction is a key component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this step, we not only show the interactive nature of the class but also its practical applicability in scenarios requiring direct user input for text similarity analysis.\n"

    "## Comprehensive Analysis of Text Similarity Results Across Four Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploration into recommending books based on textual similarity employed four distinct methods: Dot Product, Cosine Similarity, Euclidean Distance, and Jaccard Similarity. Each method offers unique insights, and by analyzing their results, we can form a nuanced understanding of the textual relationships between our reference book and others in our corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dissecting the Results Across Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dot Product Similarity:\n",
    "- 'text2.txt' leads the pack with the highest score, indicating a substantial overlap in vocabulary with our reference book. This suggests thematic or stylistic parallels.\n",
    "- 'text1.txt' and 'text3.txt' follow, with moderate and lower scores respectively, pointing to lesser degrees of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cosine Similarity:\n",
    "- Reflecting on the orientation of texts in vector space, this method also places 'text2.txt' at the top. Its high score reinforces the idea of a strong thematic alignment with our reference book.\n",
    "- The scores for 'text1.txt' and 'text3.txt' are lower, suggesting varying levels of thematic divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean Distance:\n",
    "- In this metric, lower scores denote closer similarity. 'text2.txt' scores the lowest, aligning with previous findings and underscoring its closeness to the reference book.\n",
    "- 'text1.txt' and 'text3.txt' have higher scores, indicating more significant differences in word usage and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jaccard Similarity:\n",
    "- Consistent with earlier observations, 'text2.txt' scores highest, reflecting a high degree of shared unique words.\n",
    "- The scores for 'text1.txt' and 'text3.txt' are lower, indicating less overlap in specific word occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Results and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistency of 'text2.txt' scoring high across all methods strongly suggests it as the most similar book to our reference text. This uniformity across diverse metrics indicates that not only do these books share a significant number of words, but they also align closely in thematic and stylistic aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "'text1.txt' presents as a moderately similar option, making it an appealing recommendation for readers seeking a balance of familiar and new content. 'text3.txt', while scoring lower across the board, could be recommended for readers looking for a more distinct but somewhat related reading experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Meaningful Measurement and Book Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "While each method provides valuable insights, Cosine Similarity stands out for its ability to normalize differences in text length and focus on the overall direction of the text in vector space. This makes it especially useful in capturing thematic similarities beyond mere word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering all the results, the most compelling book recommendation aligns with the consensus of our analysis: 'text2.txt'. Its consistent high scores across all metrics make it the closest match to our reference book, offering readers a familiar yet potentially enriching literary journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this multi-faceted analysis not only highlights the intricate relationships between texts but also demonstrates the effectiveness of using a blend of similarity metrics for nuanced book recommendations.\n"
